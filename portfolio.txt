#    Input your holdings here before running this program.
#    The format is:
#    token-id: number
#    If it is an NFT, append NFT_ to the start of the collection slug.

#    You can also define the currency you want with?
#    currency: brl
#    (defaults to usd if unspecified).

#    You can define the time between fetches in seconds:
#    refetch: 600
#    (defaults to 180, anything less than that might run into API rate limits).

#    It is also possible to get the total portfolio value in BTC or ETH, with the following:
#    show-btc-value: true
#    show-eth-value: true
#    Both default to false.

#    For example:

#        ethereum: 200
#        bitcoin: 100
#        link: 4000
#        NFT_milady: 274
#        currency: brl
#        refetch: 180
#        show-btc-total: true

#    The token-id must be from this list: https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/list
#    For NFTs, the endpoint used is https://api.opensea.io/api/v1/collection/{collection_slug}/stats (https://docs.opensea.io/reference/retrieving-collection-stats)
